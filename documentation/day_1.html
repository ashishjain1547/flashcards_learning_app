<pre>

1. Created the public repository on GitHub.

https://github.com/ashishjain1547/flashcards_learning_app

2. Installed VS Code and configured it with GitHub Copilot for Agentic Programming.

3. Set up space for deployment on pythonanywhere.com:

https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/ashishjaindrive1/

4. DB Details:

Database host address: ashishjaindrive1.mysql.pythonanywhere-services.com
Username: ashishjaindrive1

Database name: ashishjaindrive1$default

5. Prompt:

I want to create a flashcards learning app that allows users to create, edit, and delete (and most importantly play around with / quiz oneself using those flashcards) flashcards. The app should have a user-friendly interface and flashcards should support images. It should also allow users to track their progress and review flashcards based on their performance.

The database would be MySQL that would store the flashcards, user data, and progress tracking information. The app backend should be built using Python with a web framework like Flask.

The frontend should be built using embedded ReactJS code as Babel script in an HTML template. 
Importantly: the frontend will all be contained in a single HTML file, which will be hosted separately (FYI) on Blogger. The HTML file will include all necessary CSS and JavaScript for the ReactJS components.

All the Python code will be in a single Python file (FYI: hosted on pythonanywhere), which will handle the backend logic, database interactions, and serve the HTML file with embedded ReactJS.

The app should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. Deployment

What all configuration do I now need to make to deploy it?

-----------------------------------------

To deploy your Flashcards Learning App using your current setup (Flask backend on PythonAnywhere, React frontend as a single HTML file on Blogger or similar), follow these steps:

1. Backend (Flask on PythonAnywhere)
a. Prepare your code
Make sure your app.py is complete and working locally.
Ensure your requirements.txt contains:

flask
flask-cors
mysql-connector-python
werkzeug


b. Set up MySQL on PythonAnywhere
Go to the PythonAnywhere dashboard â†’ Databases â†’ Add a new MySQL database.
Note the database name, username, and password.
c. Update your configuration
In app.py, set:

DB_HOST = 'your-mysql-host.pythonanywhere-services.com'
DB_USER = 'your_mysql_username'
DB_PASSWORD = 'your_mysql_password'
DB_NAME = 'your_mysql_dbname'


You can use environment variables or hardcode for testing.
d. Upload your files
Upload app.py and requirements.txt to your PythonAnywhere files.
e. Install dependencies
Open a Bash console on PythonAnywhere and run:

pip install --user -r requirements.txt


f. Set up your Flask web app
Go to the Web tab â†’ Add a new web app â†’ Choose Flask.
Set the source code location to your uploaded app.py.
Set the WSGI file to point to your Flask app (usually app).
g. Allow CORS
You already have CORS(app) in your code, so your frontend can communicate with the backend.
2. Frontend (HTML on Blogger or Static Host)
a. Update API URL
In your flashcards.html, set the API variable to your PythonAnywhere domain:

const API = 'https://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com/api';


b. Upload HTML
Copy the contents of flashcards.html into a Blogger post/page (in HTML mode), or upload to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).
3. Test Everything
Open your HTML frontend in a browser.
Register a user, create flashcards, and check that everything works.
If you see CORS errors, double-check your backend domain and CORS settings.
4. (Optional) Security & Production
Set debug=False in Flask for production.
Use HTTPS for both backend and frontend.
Consider rate limiting and input validation for public deployment.

<h2>How can I install MySQL on MX Linux?</h2>

To install MySQL on MX Linux, follow these steps. MX Linux is Debian-based, so we use apt to install MySQL.

âœ… Step-by-Step Installation of MySQL on MX Linux
1. Update Package Index

sudo apt update

2. Install MySQL Server

sudo apt install mysql-server

3. Start MySQL Service

sudo systemctl start mysql

4. Enable MySQL to Start on Boot

sudo systemctl enable mysql

5. Secure MySQL Installation

Run the built-in script to set root password, remove anonymous users, disallow remote root login, etc.


sudo mysql_secure_installation

Follow the prompts:

Set root password

Remove anonymous users

Disallow remote root login

Remove test database

Reload privileges

6. Test MySQL Access
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mysql -u root -p
Enter the root password when prompted. You should get the MySQL prompt:

bash
Copy
Edit
mysql>
âœ… Optional: Install MySQL Client Tools
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install mysql-client
ðŸ”§ Common Paths
MySQL config file: /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

Data directory: /var/lib/mysql/

Service status: sudo systemctl status mysql

Let me know if you want to:

Allow remote access to MySQL

Set up a new user and database

Connect from a Python or Flask app
